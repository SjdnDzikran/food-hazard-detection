# Final Project Proposal  
*Deep Learning Course*

---

## Overview

In this project, each group will reproduce or participate in an official shared task from a recognized research venue (e.g., SemEval, WMT, TREC, CVPR workshops, NeurIPS challenges).

- Only **one** group representative per group needs to upload.  
- **Deadline:** November 13, 23:59  
  - Late submissions are subject to a penalty.
